# lazyload-css ðŸ˜´
Promise based method for adding a style sheet to the page if it has not already been added

## Install

```bash
yarn add lazyload-css
```

```bash
bower install lazyload-css
```

## Usage


`lazyLoadCSS` is packaged as a UMD module so it can be included in several ways.

> The UMD pattern typically attempts to offer compatibility with the most popular script loaders of the day (e.g RequireJS amongst others). In many cases it uses AMD as a base, with special-casing added to handle CommonJS compatibility.  
&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;[umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)

With `require()`  
```js
var lazyLoadCSS = require(`lazyLoadCSS`);
lazyLoadCSS('main.css', 'main').then(() => {
  /// main.css loaded
});

```

With VanillaJS
```js
lazyLoadCSS('main.css', 'main').then(() => {
  /// main.css loaded
});
```

Multiple scripts can asynchronously be loaded by passing an Array of `lazyLoadCSS` promises to `Promise.all()`.

```js
  Promise.all([
    lazyLoadCSS("assets/css/base.css", "base"),
    lazyLoadCSS("assets/css/layout.css", "layout")
  ]).then(() => {
    // stylesheets are loaded now
  });
```

Loading common libraries and frameworks from CDNs can be great for leveraging the browser cache, but to keep your experience functional in the event the CDN is reachable, it is recommended to load a local fallback.

For example:

```js
const promises = [
  // try to load React from a CDN, fallback to a local copy
  lazyLoadCSS("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css", "font-awesome.min.css").catch((err => (
    lazyLoadCSS(`./assets/css/vendor/font-awesome.min.css`, "font-awesome.min.css")
  ))),
  lazyLoadCSS("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/weather-icons/2.0.9/css/weather-icons.min.css", "weather-icons.min.css").catch((err => (
    lazyLoadCSS(`./assets/css/vendor/weather-icons.min.css`, "weather-icons.min.css")
  )))
];


Promise.all(promises).then(() => {
  font awesome and weather icons style sheets are loaded now!
});
```
